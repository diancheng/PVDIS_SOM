Stuff needed for PVDIS SOM.  

1. A plot or a table of polarization measurements, both Compton and Moller.

2. The average beam polarization during the run, separately Compton and
Moller.

3. A plot or a table of the dithering results, the corrections to 
the asymmetry on a run-by-run basis.  Also the total average correction.
It was negligible, I'm sure.

4. A plot related to target boiling.  I'm thinking of the width in
asymmetry vs beam current for a large raster, or a set of curves 
for different raster.  The fan speed is another variable, so pick
the highest speed.  I'm open to suggestions here.
